          <h1>Inclue: An experience for everyone!</h1>
          <p>
            Inclue is a project about digital accessibility developed within the
            scope of the Master in New Media and Web Practices, together with 3
            colleagues. Our objective is, through interviews with real
            testimonies, of what it is like to live in the digital age with some
            disability that makes digital accessibility difficult, to educate
            and sensitize students and future professionals in the area.
          </p>
          <p>
            We created several versions of the same video, in which we present a
            completely inaccessible version to the user. After viewing it, you
            will be able to choose a "character" and view the video from the
            point of view of his disability. That said, you will realize the
            problem in question and have access to excerpts from the interview
            and images provided by the selected user. On the page about the
            project, we present the ideal version of this video, accessible to
            everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essentially an interactive web documentary about accessibility
            and digital inclusion, where the paths that users can choose reflect
            different perceptions of reality, according to a disability (visual,
            hearing, etc.). The user has an exploratory stance towards the
            content, accessing pre-existing options that make connections with
            media files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to time constraints this project was not finished, therefore,
            this is a sketch of our ideas.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Interface developers do not have a high degree of responsibility and
            attention to the accessibility of digital platforms. Often, people
            with disabilities are unable to access content due to the lack of
            adequate resources for their condition.
          </p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            Through an interactive platform designed according to the different
            types of disabilities, the common user will be able to access the
            content, as if they had the disability, and this will allow an
            “immersion” in the reality of the problem.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <h1>Interviews</h1>
          <p>
            We decided that we would conduct interviews with two types of users:
            computer engineers or programmers (from students to senior
            developers) and with professionals in the field of digital content
            creation. These two profiles would help us better understand the
            digital product market and why accessibility is still lacking, both
            in interfaces and content.
          </p>
          <p>
            We created a brief script so that all group members could do the
            same interview. Each member did two interviews, which took place in
            person or remotely. Below is the script used:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do you study or have studied the subject of accessibility?</li>
            <li>
              How much do you know about disabilities when it comes to
              accessibility?
            </li>
            <li>Do you know how a screen reader works?</li>
            <li>Do you consider accessibility in your work?</li>
            <li>Do you know the daily life of a person with a disability?</li>
            <li>
              Do you think there is a lack of awareness about this subject?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="text" data-aos="fade-right">
          <h1>Afinity Map</h1>
          <p>
            After completing and transcribing the interviews, we moved on to the
            stage of analyzing and grouping the responses. Each group member
            selected relevant excerpts from the answers obtained, placing them
            on sticky notes in Miro. Afterwards, we carried out a brief review
            of similarities, which when grouped together, resulted in our
            affinity map.

              They seem to have a very tenuous notion of what a screen reader
              is, and it is important to note that the majority have never seen
              one in use;
            </li>
            <li>
              Everyone agrees that although it has improved, there is still a
              great lack of awareness on the subject;
            </li>
            <li>
              It seems that companies still prefer to produce content for the
              common user, with accessibility not being a priority;
            </li>
            <li>
              They all know different disabilities, however, none of them know
              the daily challenges of those with one.

          <h1>Content & Flow</h1>
          <p>
            To start producing content for our project, we thought of some video
            solutions. We decided that we would do interviews on a white
            background in the studio with people with disabilities who could
            tell us about the difficulties they face in the digital world. We
            contacted some institutions to ask for interviewees and got three
            contacts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>André Almeida:</strong> deaf (Interpreter required);
            </li>
            <li><strong>André Muricy:</strong> colorblind;</li>
            <li><strong>Rita Pereira:</strong> dyslexic.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We decided to try to create as much content as possible and build a
            prototype around it, adapting what we could.
          </p>
          <h3 class="list">What we aim for:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              On the first screen, a fixed background image or just the logo
              will appear on a white background and when scrolling, the
              introductory video will appear. This will contain the information
              that it is an immersive experience, with sound and that you can
              use the keyboard to navigate. It's a kind of on board;
            </li>
            <li>
              When scrolling, we come across the third screen, which consists of
              the split screen where the user will choose one of the
              experiences. Here we will place conceptual photos, creating a
              surprise factor and arousing the user's curiosity to want to know
              that testimony just because of what the image suggests and the
              brief description of it;
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the experience is selected, an adapted video appears
              depending on the choice made. Therefore, this fourth screen is the
              presentation of a testimony with the difficulty represented in the
              video. To access this content, the user simply needs to scroll
              after the adapted video has finished;
            </li>
            <li>
              We agreed that it would not be aesthetically appealing and that it
              could make it difficult to read certain content if the navigation
              bar was present throughout the experiences. However, navigation
              can be done using the links in the footer or the back and next
              experience buttons, which will be found at the end of the page;
            </li>
            <li>
              We considered it relevant to add the "About us" page where the
              team members will be presented, a "About the project" page delving
              deeper into our concept and objectives, and finally, "Know more"
              so that we can provide the contacts of the associations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We intend to create an interface that works specifically based on
            scrolling and content that appears with subtle effects throughout
            the page. With this, we intend to make these stories known with a
            small differentiation, which consists of exposing the problems and
            possible solutions suggested by those who really have difficulties
            with digital accessibility.

          <h1>Sitemap</h1>
          <p>
            Although simple, we created a site map to evaluate navigation,
            ensuring that users can easily find the content they want and
            improving their experience.

          <h1>Branding</h1>
          <p>
            Now that we have refined the overall structure of the app we focused
            on creating Inclue's branding to effectively communicate the brand
            personality through the website.

          <h1>Logo Design</h1>
          <p>
            Inclue was born from the search for a short name, which symbolized
            the idea of the documentary in its form and content. The result
            arose from the combination of the words "inclusive" and "clue",
            which means inclusion and knowledge of the different experiences and
            challenges associated with them, and the interactive experience from
            which the user will leave with several clues on how to improve
            digital accessibility.
            <br />After selecting the name, we began experimenting in Adobe
            Illustrator. From simpler options where we try to make the union of
            the two concepts perceptible, to more daring ones, in which we take
            the concepts as a whole and explore the graphic component.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container" data-aos="zoom-in">
            <img src="assets/inclue/logos.png" alt="logo options" />
          </div>
          <p>
            From the options above we decided to opt for the one in the bottom
            right corner.
            <br />
            We presented our logo proposal to 36 people who were unaware of the
            purpose of our project and came to the conclusion that 100% of those
            questioned understood the word represented, always on the first try.
            A recurring observation was the fact that it requires some
            concentration to perceive it, however, it is always correct.<br />
            That being said, we made small adjustments to the letters that
            people found it most difficult to decipher. Without deconstructing
            the basic idea, in which the word was drawn only with geometric
            shapes, we used miniatures of them to create more characteristic and
            recognizable elements of the alphabet. Although subtle, these small
            openings (visible in the letters N, C and U) make reading easier,
            however, they allow us to maintain the initial aesthetic of the
            logo.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container1" data-aos="zoom-in">
            <img src="assets/inclue/incluelogo.png" alt="logo" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Our logo was built based on the Roboto font. We subjected each
            letter of the word Inclue to a geometrization process, using
            different geometric shapes that were complemented with slight
            transparencies and overlaps. Since the word itself already carries
            the meaning of inclusion, the set of different shapes gives the
            symbolism of union and strength, focusing on our main objective,
            which is raising awareness through an experience accessible to
            everyone. By adding these geometric elements to the selected
            typography, we give it a differentiating character that can also be
            transformed into graphic elements that can complement our identity
            in the future.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container1" data-aos="zoom-in">

          </div>
          <p>
            We subjected the logo to a color contrast test using the Chrome
            plugin Dalton. Thus, we obtained confirmation that there would be
            sufficient contrast between the selected colors so that they would
            be easily distinguishable by those suffering from color blindness.
            In the image above, we can visualize this color conversion, with the
            most frequent types of color blindness.

        </div>

        <div class="text" data-aos="fade-right">
          <h1>Style Guide</h1>
          <p>
            In order to appeal to a young audience, the image of our project is
            colorful and full of personality. Through blue we intend to convey
            the idea of security, stability and calm. Yellow contrasts with
            blue, due to its vivacity and energy. Purple symbolizes wisdom and
            knowledge and is used by brands that value human beings in
            general.<br />
            In this case, the choice of colors was essential for the general
            development of our project, since, according to our research, it
            would be extremely important to select suitable colors in terms of
            accessibility and play with contrast, making them more easily
            distinguishable.<br />
            The selected colors create a good contrast between each other,
            providing easy distinction between shades for those suffering from
            color blindness. Although less common among the different types of
            color blindness, the shade of purple we selected is the most
            visually contrasting color for those suffering from Tritanopia.<br />
            The font used in the logo, Roboto, will also be used on the website.
            Simple and sans serif, to facilitate reading for people with reduced
            vision, dyslexia or cognitive and neurological difficulties.

            worked on creating lofi wireframe sketches.

            To define the layout of the website, we created some simple
            wireframes and a static prototype that made it easier to see where
            the content we already had would be inserted.

            At the time, we didn't know Figma's potential, we were still
            learning. And since it did not allow the free insertion of videos,
            which would be the main content of our project, we had to develop
            the prototype with the help of another tool.

            After defining the static prototype, it was possible to proceed with
            the interactive prototype. The implementation was done with the help
            of our teacher, who transformed the Figma model into a page with
            real interaction.

            At the moment, the site is not responsive, with desktop only
            availability. After completing the academic project, we will be able
            to correct and improve the interactive prototype through a re-design
            process. Below you can check the version used in usability tests:

          <h1>Usability Test</h1>
          <p>
            In order to clarify doubts about our website, we carried out
            usability tests with four people. These interacted with what we can
            consider a demo version of the prototype, as it is still under
            construction.<br />
            Since our project is fundamentally narrative and exploratory in
            nature, we adapt usability tests to a simple opinion after browsing
            the website. Unlike the typical tasks to be performed, we leave the
            user completely free to explore, which allowed us to conclude how
            easily they navigate/find what they want, whether they understand
            the main objective of the project and what doesn't work or could be
            improved.<br />
            We also left it up to the user whether they preferred to comment
            during or after the test, although they could provide a more concise
            analysis at the end of the test.

          <h1>Priority Revisions</h1>
          <h3>Most frequent suggestions:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The navigation bar should not appear on the first page and make it
              clear that the project is an interactive documentary;
            </li>
            <li>
              In terms of accessibility, it is important that there are more
              arrows indicating the path to follow and that the user understands
              what to do when they finish watching a video;
            </li>
            <li>
              It is essential to find a solution for inserting videos on the
              website that brings some integrity to the documentary in visual
              terms. Youtube's recommendations, file names and starting frames
              do not allow the user to truly indulge in the interactive
              experience;
            </li>
            <li>
              Change the thumbnails, which are all the same. If we change each
              thumbnail to the information that will be displayed, we create
              greater motivation and interest in the user;
            </li>
            <li>
              Insert a clearer message into disability immersion videos, so that
              the user understands that, despite it looking like the same video,
              they need to watch it again;
            </li>
            <li>André Almeida's page may have fewer videos;</li>
            <li>
              Written information should be clearer overall and cohesive,
              including font size should be improved;
            </li>
            <li>
              Present suggestions for improvements to digital accessibility in
              writing at the end of the experience.

            When we selected the concept of inclusion and accessibility for our
            project, we had the opportunity to delve into this topic and
            communicate with people who taught us a lot and made us think. In
            general, we are satisfied with the final result of the project,
            however we would like to see the final version of the website
            implemented, focusing on its interactivity, as it is not finished.
            If I were to push this project further, I would:
