          <h1>Inclue: An experience for everyone!</h1>
          <p>
            Inclue is a project about digital accessibility developed within the
            scope of the Master's program in New Media and Web Practices, together
            with 3 colleagues. Our objective is, through interviews with real
            testimonies, to explore what it's like to live in the digital age with
            disabilities that pose digital accessibility challenges. The aim is to
            educate and sensitize students and future professionals in the area.
          </p>
          <p>
            We created several versions of the same video, simulating accessibility
            challenges for the user. After watching it, you will be able to choose a
            'character' and watch the video from the perspective of their disability.
            That way, you will understand the challenges faced and have access to
            excerpts from the interview and images provided by the selected user.
            On the project page, we present the ideal version of this video,
            accessible to everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essentially an interactive web documentary about accessibility and
            digital inclusion, where users can choose paths that reflect various
            perspectives of reality, according to a disability (visual, hearing, etc.).
            The user has an exploratory stance towards the content, exploring predefined
            options that connect to multimedia content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to complete this project.
            However, I considered the concept relevant to share, and what follows is a
            sketch of our ideas.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Interface developers do not have a high degree of responsibility and
            attention to the accessibility of digital platforms. Often, people
            with disabilities are unable to access content due to the lack of
            adequate resources for their condition.
          </p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            Through an interactive platform designed according to the different
            types of disabilities, the common user will be able to access the
            content, as if they had the disability, and this will allow an
            “immersion” in the reality of the problem.

          <h1>Interviews</h1>
          <p>
            We decided to conduct interviews with two types of users: computer
            engineers or programmers (ranging from students to senior developers)
            and professionals in the field of digital content creation. These two
            profiles would help us better understand the digital product market
            and why accessibility is still lacking, both in interfaces and content.
          </p>
          <p>
            We created a brief script to ensure that all group members conducted the same interview.
            Each member did two interviews, which took place in person or remotely. Below is the script used:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Have you studied or taken courses related to accessibility?</li>
            <li>How much do you know about disabilities when it comes to accessibility?</li>
            <li>Do you know how a screen reader works?</li>
            <li>Do you consider accessibility in your work?</li>
            <li>Do you know the daily life of a person with a disability?</li>
            <li>Do you think there is a lack of awareness about this subject?</li>

          <p>
            After completing and transcribing the interviews, we proceeded to
            analyze and group the responses. Each group member selected pertinent
            excerpts from the obtained answers, placing them on sticky notes in Miro.
            Subsequently, we conducted a brief review of similarities, which, when
            grouped together, formed our affinity map.

            <li>
              There is a tenuous understanding of what a screen reader is,
              with the majority having never seen one in use;
            </li>
            <li>
              While awareness has improved, there's still a significant lack
              of understanding on the subject;
            </li>
            <li>
              It seems that companies tend to prioritize content for the common
              user, and accessibility is not considered a priority;
            </li>
            <li>
              While participants are aware of various disabilities, none of
              them are familiar with the daily challenges faced by individuals
              with disabilities.

          <h1>Content & Flow</h1>
          <p>
            To start producing content for our project, we thought of some video
            solutions. We decided that we would do interviews on a white
            background in the studio with people with disabilities who could
            tell us about the difficulties they face in the digital world. We
            contacted some institutions to ask for interviewees and got three
            contacts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>André Almeida:</strong> deaf (Interpreter required);</li>
            <li><strong>André Muricy:</strong> colorblind;</li>
            <li><strong>Rita Pereira:</strong> dyslexic.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We decided to try to create as much content as possible and build a
            prototype around it, adapting what we could.
          </p>
          <h3 class="list">What we aim for:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              On the first screen, a fixed background image or just the logo
              will appear on a white background and when scrolling, the
              introductory video will appear. This will contain the information
              that it is an immersive experience, with sound and that you can
              use the keyboard to navigate. It's a kind of on board;
            </li>
            <li>
              When scrolling, we come across the third screen, which consists of
              the split screen where the user will choose one of the
              experiences. Here we will place conceptual photos, creating a
              surprise factor and arousing the user's curiosity to want to know
              that testimony just because of what the image suggests and the
              brief description of it;
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the experience is selected, an adapted video appears
              depending on the choice made. Therefore, this fourth screen is the
              presentation of a testimony with the difficulty represented in the
              video. To access this content, the user simply needs to scroll
              after the adapted video has finished;
            </li>
            <li>
              We agreed that it would not be aesthetically appealing and that it
              could make it difficult to read certain content if the navigation
              bar were present throughout the experiences. However, navigation can
              be done using the links in the footer or the 'back' and 'next
              experience' buttons, which will be found at the end of the page;
            </li>
            <li>
              We considered it relevant to add the "About us" page where the
              team members will be presented, a "About the project" page delving
              deeper into our concept and objectives, and finally, "Know more"
              so that we can provide the contacts of the associations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We intend to create an interface that works specifically based on
            scrolling and content that appears with subtle effects throughout
            the page. With this, we intend to make these stories known with a
            small differentiation, which consists of exposing the problems and
            possible solutions suggested by those who really have difficulties
            with digital accessibility.

            Despite its simplicity, we crafted a site map to assess navigation,
            ensuring users can easily find the content they seek and enhancing
            their overall experience.

          <p>
            Now that we have refined the overall structure of the app, we are
            focusing on creating Inclue's branding to effectively communicate
            the brand personality through the website.

          <h1>Logo Design</h1>
          <p>
            Inclue was born from the search for a concise name that encapsulates
            the essence of the documentary, embodying both its form and content.
            The result emerged from the fusion of 'inclusive' and 'clue,' symbolizing
            not only inclusion and understanding of diverse experiences and challenges
            but also the interactive experience designed to offer users valuable
            insights on improving digital accessibility.
            <br>After selecting the name, we began experimenting in Adobe
            Illustrator, exploring simpler options to make the union of the two
            concepts perceptible and more daring ones that took the concepts as a
            whole and explored the graphic component.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container" data-aos="zoom-in">
            <img src="assets/inclue/logos.png" alt="logo options">
          </div>
          <p>
            From the options above, we decided to opt for the one in the bottom
            right corner.<br>
            We presented our logo proposal to 36 people unfamiliar with our
            project's purpose. The conclusion was that 100% of respondents
            understood the represented word on the first try. A recurring
            observation was that it requires some concentration to perceive,
            but it is always correct.<br>
            With that in mind, we made minor adjustments to the letters that
            people found most challenging to decipher. Without deviating from
            the fundamental idea of constructing the word with geometric shapes,
            we incorporated miniature elements to enhance the characteristics and
            recognition of each letter in the alphabet. Although subtle, the
            small openings (visible in the letters N, C, and U) facilitate readability
            while preserving the logo's initial aesthetic.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container1" data-aos="zoom-in">

          </div>
          <p>
            Our logo was constructed based on the Roboto font. Each letter of the word
            'Inclue' underwent a geometrization process, incorporating various geometric
            shapes with subtle transparencies and overlaps. Given that the word itself
            conveys the essence of inclusion, the diverse shapes symbolize unity and
            strength, aligning with our primary goal of promoting awareness through an
            universally accessible experience. By integrating these geometric elements
            into the chosen typography, we imbue it with a distinctive character that
            can also serve as versatile graphic elements to complement our identity
            in the future.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container1" data-aos="zoom-in">

          </div>
          <p>
            We conducted a color contrast test on the logo using the Dalton Chrome
            plugin. This confirmed that there would be ample contrast between the
            selected colors, ensuring easy distinguishability for individuals with
            color blindness. In the image above, you can visualize this color conversion,
            depicting the most prevalent types of color blindness.

        </div>

        <div class="text" data-aos="fade-right">
          <h1>Style Guide</h1>
          <p>
            To resonate with a youthful audience, our project's image is vibrant
            and brimming with personality. The use of blue aims to convey a sense
            of security, stability, and calmness. Yellow, in contrast, brings
            vivacity and energy and purple, symbolizing wisdom and knowledge, is
            often employed by brands that value humanity as a whole.<br>
            The color selection played a pivotal role in our project's overall
            development. Our research underscored the importance of choosing
            colors with accessibility in mind, emphasizing the play with contrast
            to enhance distinguishability.<br>
            The selected colors exhibit excellent contrast, ensuring easy differentiation
            for individuals with color blindness. While Tritanopia is less common,
            the specific shade of purple we chose is visually contrasting for those
            with this form of color blindness.<br>
            The Roboto font used in the logo will also take a prominent place on the
            website. Its simplicity and sans-serif design aim to facilitate reading for
            individuals with reduced vision, dyslexia, or cognitive and neurological difficulties.

            At the time, still in the learning phase and unaware of Figma's
            full potential, we found limitations in its ability to freely
            insert videos, the primary content for our project. Consequently,
            we had to resort to another tool for prototype development.

            After finalizing the static prototype, we proceeded to develop the
            interactive prototype with the guidance of our teacher, who translated
            the Figma model into a page with real interactions.

            Currently, the site is not responsive and is only available for desktop
            use. Post-completion of the academic project, we plan to refine and
            enhance the interactive prototype through a redesign process. Below,
            you can check the version utilized in usability tests:

          <p>
            In order to address questions about our website, we conducted usability
            tests with four individuals. They interacted with what we consider a
            demo version of the prototype, which is still in progress.<br>
            Given the narrative and exploratory nature of our project, we adapted
            the usability tests to gather opinions after users explored the website.
            Unlike typical task-oriented tests, we allowed users complete freedom to
            explore. This approach helped us assess how easily they navigated and
            found information, whether they grasped the main objective of the project,
            and identified areas that didn't work or could be improved.<br>
            Users were given the option to provide feedback during or after the test.

            <li>
              Diversify the thumbnails, making each one unique to the information

            <li>
              Include a clearer message in disability immersion videos, guiding

              Consider reducing the number of videos on André Almeida's page

            When we chose the concept of inclusion and accessibility for our project,
            we had the opportunity to delve into this topic and communicate with
            people who taught us a lot and made us think. Overall, we are satisfied
            with the final result of the project, however, we would like to see the
            website's final version implemented, focusing on its interactivity, as
            it is not finished. If I were to take this project further, I would:
