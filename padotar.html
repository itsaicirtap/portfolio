            This project is part of my master's thesis, so I will only refer to
            the content that actually corresponds to the mobile app and its

            In this project I tried to combine my love for animals with a
            serious public health problem, as there is currently a significant
            increase in the number of abandoned animals, which results in a
            worrying situation that is placing a burden on animal protection and
            shelter associations. As we know, many animal shelters already have
            social media accounts and most of their advertising takes place
            there. But unlike these, where it's not possible to separate posts
            by topic, in this app we can find a variety of content categorized
            in such a way as to provide an intuitive user experience. Above all,
            the aim is to facilitate the adoption process, communication with
            the shelters and the dissemination not only of the activities
            carried out by them, but also the educational content that pet
            owners frequently search for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Padotar is a fictitious shelter created purely for the project and
            the conception of the mobile app was restricted to the process of
            developing a digital product from a design perspective, so it was
            not implemented after the evaluation of the interactive hi-fi
            prototype.

          <p>
            No animal shelter in the research area offers a mobile app with
            adoption features, direct communication and properly organized
            informative and educational content.
          </p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            Development of a mobile app so that any animal shelters can
            replicate it, as it was developed based on factors that will
            possibly contribute to increasing adoption levels.

          <h1>Local Shelters Analysis</h1>
          <p>
            An analysis of the panorama of local animal shelters and the
            strategies implemented online was carried out. It was therefore
            found that, with the exception of one shelter, all others provide a
            web page or a profile on social media. However, none of them have
            their own mobile app. Out of 18 shelters:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>17 have a Facebook profile;</li>
            <li>13 have their own website;</li>
            <li>11 have an Instagram profile;</li>
            <li>2 of them have a Youtube channel;</li>
            <li>But none of them have a mobile app.</li>

          <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
          <p>
            To get an idea of the strengths and weaknesses of possible
            competition, I carried out a brief survey of similar apps existing
            in Portugal. I say brief, since I only found one website matching
            the search criteria, and it's not even a mobile app.<br />
            We are talking about
            <a href="https://petify.io/" target="_blank">Petify</a>, which is an
            interactive platform whose objective is to help abandoned animals
            find a family. This website essentially works like “lost and found”,
            where individuals or shelters can place advertisements for adoptions
            or lost animals.

          <h1>Interviews</h1>
          <p>
            To carry out these interviews, people who work in institutions
            dedicated to the animal cause were selected in order to understand
            the needs of shelters, in order to inform the design of the product
            to be produced. In this case, the shelters are our stakeholders.<br />
            Two interviews were carried out during which participants had the
            opportunity to share problems and needs, contributing relevant
            information to the development of the project. In total, twelve
            questions were asked, divided into the general context of the
            shelter, the adoption process, the impact of new media and the
            implementation of alternative digital tools.<br />
            Subsequently, in a brief informal conversation with two possible
            users about the research topic of this project, some information
            emerged that was considered relevant not only for defining the
            functionalities to be implemented, but also for creating personas
            faithful to real experiences.

          <h1>Prioritize Features</h1>
          <p>
            Due to the inherent temporal limitations within the project scope, I
            was confronted with the challenge of carefully selecting and
            prioritizing features for the app's design. The extensive list of
            proposed features needed to be streamlined in the face of limited
            time resources, so i decided to remove two features that were
            probably gonna take more time to create and yet didn't affect the
            main purpose of the project.
          </p>
          <h3 class="list">Features that move on to the next stage:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Search filter:</strong> allows the user to select the
              desired characteristics when searching for a pet;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Adopt:</strong> the aim is to show the user all the pets
              available for adoption and provide detailed information about each
              one. When selecting the option to adopt, the user is presented
              with a form, which once completed will be sent directly to the
              association;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quiz:</strong> initial multiple-choice questionnaire for
              the user to understand whether they are ready to adopt. It will be
              an optional game that will appear as a highlight on the home page;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>News:</strong> given the importance of informing users
              about what they are contributing to and who they are helping, it
              will be pertinent to provide news about the work and activities
              carried out by the shelter;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Articles:</strong> in order to reduce impulse adoptions,
              it is essential to include a feature that provides articles of an
              educational/informative nature, which support important decisions
              such as adopting an animal and inform about the respective care
              and inherent responsibilities;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Training:</strong> since most behaviors are a consequence
              of inadequate training or a lack of stimulation, it is important
              to provide content such as step by step training so that owners
              can easily follow and replicate them at home with their pets;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How to help:</strong> considering that many of these
              institutions survive thanks to the support received from their
              followers, information such as patronize, partners, volunteers and
              means of donation must have due visibility;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>FAQ:</strong> so that there are no doubts about the
              adoption process, the most frequently asked questions will be
              available for any user to have access to.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="list">Features that were excluded:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Pet hotel map:</strong> incorporating an interactive pet
              hotel map, designed to enhance the pet owners' experience by
              providing detailed, real-time information on available
              accommodations for their pets stay;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Solidary shop:</strong> since this is a common resource
              between shelters, it would be interesting to integrate a small
              solidarity store, in which all sales would go towards the
              financial sustainability of the association.
            </li>

          <h1>Sitemap</h1>
          <p>
            Focusing on the prioritized solutions, I created this sitemap to
            help me define the overall structure of the content on Padotar's app
            in a way that would be logical and easy to navigate for users.

          <h2>Branding</h2>
          <h1>Branding</h1>
          <p>
            Now that i have refined the overall structure of the app, the
            question now was - what will it look like? Before working on the UI,
            I focused on creating Padotar's branding to effectively communicate
            the brand personality through the app.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text" data-aos="fade-right">
          <h1>Logo Design</h1>
          <p>
            Given the importance of visual identity in the implementation of
            digital products, I considered it pertinent to create a graphic
            brand. I tried above all to maintain a simple and minimalist
            aesthetic, in order to provide a legible and visually impactful
            image. <br />Therefore, the first step was to select the name of the
            fictitious shelter for which the application was developed. Since it
            is a shelter for animals looking for a family and the comfort of a
            home, the words “para” and “adotar” were combined. These become the
            word “padotar” which, coincidentally, results in a sound effect
            similar to their hurried pronunciation. <br />After selecting his
            name, a process of experimenting with the graphic brand began, using
            the digital tool Adobe Illustrator. As can be seen in the figure
            below, a brief study of colors was carried out, always associated
            with neutral tones that refer to pet fur. Above all, I tried to
            maintain a simple and minimalist aesthetic, in order to provide a
            legible and visually impactful image.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container" data-aos="zoom-in">
            <img src="assets/padotar/Imagem1.png" alt="logo options" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Once the brand was defined, I introduced the typography, giving rise
            to the logo.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container1" data-aos="zoom-in">
            <img src="assets/padotar/Imagem2.png" alt="logo" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Padotar's brand image is characterized by the symbol representing a
            dog and a cat inside a shelter, the animals most commonly found in
            these institutions, and by the logo, which obviously corresponds to
            the shelter's name.<br />
            Orange was chosen as the main color due to its contrast with other
            elements, and so the graphic brand will also convey the shelter's
            values, including joy, trust, strength and ambition. In order to
            maintain consistency with the interface design, this color will be
            used in other visual components.<br />
            For the logo, a simple sans-serif font, Futura, was chosen and a
            bold style was used to visually balance and highlight the shelter's
            name.

            In order to make the experience appealing to the user, I used a
            strong color full of personality, orange. As a complement, I
            selected a pastel shade, which represents a color analogous to
            orange, as it is found in its sequence within the color wheel. The
            fact that we use a pastel shade as opposed to the bright color
            itself, aims to convey serenity and comfort to the user. The shade
            of black is applied to the text and the RGB values are not at 100%,
            thus avoiding creating an excessively strong contrast, which would
            harm the vision of a user who stays in the app for a long time.
            <br />
            Regarding the selected fonts, the aim is simplicity, and in order to
            facilitate reading for people with reduced vision, dyslexia or
            cognitive and neurological difficulties, two sans serif fonts were
            defined, Futura and Avenir Next. The first one was previously used
            in the creation of the logo and, as such, to maintain visual
            coherence, it was applied to the titles. The second corresponds to
            all other written content, thus allowing the distinction between
            headings and paragraphs of text.

            Here's when I started to make decisions on how the content on
            Padotar's app would be organized based on the project goals I wanted
            to meet. I then developed a low-fidelity wireframe of the main
            pages, still with basic geometric shapes and few details, allowing
            focus on flow and features.

            At this stage, it would be essential to deepen the interface in
            order to make the complete user flow visible and explore how to
            really make the process of searching for and adopting a pet as
            intuitive as possible. Here it is already possible to get an idea of
            how the interface will behave when performing more specific tasks.

            Two people were asked to analyze and comment on the prototype in

            decided to simplify and reduce some of the features.

          <h3 class="list">List of insights obtained through these tests:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Dark mode isn't a relevant feature at the moment, I have to
              prioritize features;
            </li>
            <li>
              On the home page, remove the “What are you looking for” options.
              It's redundant since they're all available in the menu;
            </li>
            <li>
              In the quiz, inform the progress through “Question X of X”,
              because in percentage terms the user doesn't know how many
              questions there are. Do not ask too many questions to avoid making
              the activity boring;
            </li>
            <li>
              When entering adoptions, we come across an entire page of filters
              to help you search for the ideal pet. The search bar here is
              meaningless as filters are provided for all important
              characteristics. If the user wants to view all the pets first,
              they will have the option to “See all”;
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove favorites, login and profile, since the existence of a user
              would only make sense to maintain a favorites list;
            </li>
            <li>
              In this case, the app settings are also useless, as all features
              that could be customizable have been removed;
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix general articles, training and news, and put a search filter.
              This way, similar information is compiled in a single tab and the
              options listed in the menu are reduced;
            </li>
            <li>
              With this reduction of tabs to about five elements, try to include
              the menu at the bottom of the screen.

          <h2>Test</h2>
          <h1>Test Responses</h1>
          <p>
            The objective of these tests was to identify usability problems that
            users may encounter in the interface and receive feedback with the
            aim of improving it. Six participants were recruited and all
            performed the same tasks to allow comparison.<br />
            Six tasks were assigned and all participants managed to complete
            them successfully, with the exception of task 2. In this particular
            task, even with difficulty, only one of the participants managed to
            complete it. This consisted of finding the FAQ to clarify a question
            about adoption.<br />
            Once the tests were finished, I gave them the opportunity to freely
            explore the interface and a brief exit questionnaire was carried out
            where participants were able to give their evaluation and
            suggestions. The prototype obtained an average rating of 8.5 out of
            10.

          <p>
            Since it would not be possible to carry out all the suggested
            changes, it was necessary to prioritize the findings, so I used the
            Nielsen Scale to carry out this task. After classifying each
            suggestion, I decided to prioritize the 4 most problematic, which
            were also the most mentioned by different users.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Since the button padding was small, making it difficult to
              navigate the interface, their padding was increased.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since most users prefer to view all animals available for adoption
              first, the filter becomes optional. Thus, when clicking on “Adopt”
              in the menu, we are directed to the list of available animals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since around 85% of users did not find the FAQ, it was placed in
              the most suggested place, in “About Us”, followed by the contact
              form, in case your question was not clarified.
            </li>
            <li>
              Considering that the adoption form is within each animal's
              profile, data such as the type of animal and its name are now
              pre-filled.

            In order to prioritize the user experience, an iterative approach
            was adopted based on the methodology of the UCD process, where
            constant validation was sought among potential users. I think this
            method was really effective in quickly identifying initial
            roadblocks to our user’s goals in the design and to make sure that
            the overall layout of content itself is effective and functional. If

            Features". I also consider it relevant to mention that, in
            accordance with what was said in one of the interviews, it would be
            worth considering the implementation of a database at national
            level, which includes all the shelters and animals housed in them.
            In this way, and responding to the needs of potential adopters in
            any area of the country, allowing pets to move, giving them a
            greater chance of adoption. As such, the development of this project
