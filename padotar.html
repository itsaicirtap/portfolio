            Padotar: Helping people find the perfect pet or related educational
            and informative content
          </h1>
          <p>
            This project is part of my master's thesis, so I will only refer to
            the content that actually corresponds to the mobile app and its
            research. However, if you are interested in reading the full text,
            you can do so

          <p>
            In this project, I aimed to combine my love for animals with addressing 
            a serious public health problem. Currently, there is a significant increase 
            in the number of abandoned animals, leading to a worrying situation that places 
            a burden on animal protection and shelter associations. Many animal shelters 
            have social media accounts, where most of their advertising takes place. 
            However, unlike these platforms where it's not possible to separate posts by 
            topic, this app offers a variety of content categorized to provide an 
            intuitive user experience. The primary goal is to facilitate the adoption 
            process, enhance communication with shelters, and disseminate not only their 
            activities but also educational content frequently sought by pet owners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Padotar is a fictitious shelter created purely for the project. The conception 
            of the mobile app was restricted to the process of developing a digital 
            product from a design perspective and was not implemented after the 
            evaluation of the interactive hi-fi prototype.

          <p>
            No animal shelter in the research area offers a mobile app with
            adoption features, direct communication and properly organized
            informative and educational content.
          </p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            Developing a mobile app that can be replicated by any animal 
            shelter. The app incorporates features such as adoption functionalities, 
            direct communication, and well-organized informative and educational 
            content, all designed to potentially enhance adoption rates.

          <h1>Local Shelters Analysis</h1>
          <p>
            An analysis of the panorama of local animal shelters and the 
            strategies implemented online revealed the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>17 have a Facebook profile;</li>
            <li>13 have their own website;</li>
            <li>11 have an Instagram profile;</li>
            <li>2 of them have a Youtube channel.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, none of the 18 shelters have their own mobile app.

          <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
          <p>
            To gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of potential competitors, 
            I conducted a brief survey of similar apps existing in Portugal. Despite the 
            limited scope of my search, I identified only one website that matched the 
            search criteria, and it's not even a mobile app.<br>
            The platform in question is 
            <a href="https://petify.io/" target="_blank">Petify</a>, an interactive platform 
            with the primary goal of assisting abandoned animals in finding a family. 
            Petify operates essentially like a "lost and found," allowing individuals or 
            shelters to post advertisements for adoptions or lost animals.

          <h1>Interviews</h1>
          <p>
            To conduct these interviews, individuals working in institutions 
            dedicated to the animal cause were selected to understand the needs of 
            shelters, treating the shelters as our stakeholders.<br>
            Two interviews were conducted, during which participants shared 
            problems and needs, providing valuable information for the project's 
            development. In total, twelve questions were asked, covering the general 
            context of the shelter, the adoption process, the impact of new media, 
            and the implementation of alternative digital tools.<br>
            Subsequently, in a brief informal conversation with two potential users 
            on the research topic, relevant information emerged. This information not 
            only aided in defining the functionalities to be implemented but also in 
            creating personas that reflect real experiences.

          <h1>Prioritize Features</h1>
          <p>
            Due to the inherent temporal limitations within the project scope, I 
            was confronted with the challenge of carefully selecting and prioritizing 
            features for the app's design. The extensive list of proposed features 
            needed to be streamlined in the face of limited time resources, so I 
            decided to remove two features that were probably going to take more 
            time to create and yet didn't affect the main purpose of the project.
          </p>
          <h3 class="list">Features that move on to the next stage:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Search Filter:</strong> Allows the user to select the
              desired characteristics when searching for a pet;

            <li>
              <strong>Adopt:</strong> Displays all available pets with detailed information
               and an adoption form that is sent directly to the shelter;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quiz:</strong> An initial optional multiple-choice questionnaire, 
              assessing readiness to adopt;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>News:</strong> Provides updates on the shelter's work and 
              activities carried out;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Articles:</strong> Offers educational/ informative content to 
              guide decisions and responsibilities of pet adoption;

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Pet Hotel Map:</strong> Incorporating an interactive map 
              of pet hotels, designed to enhance the pet owners' experience by 
              providing detailed, real-time information on available accommodations 
              for their pets' stay;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Solidary Shop:</strong> Since this is a common resource
              among shelters, it would have been interesting to integrate a 
              small solidarity store. In this store, all sales would have gone 
              toward the financial sustainability of the association.

          <h1>Branding</h1>
          <p>
            Now that i have refined the overall structure of the app, the
            question now was - what will it look like? Before working on the UI,
            I focused on creating Padotar's branding to effectively communicate
            the brand personality through the app.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text" data-aos="fade-right">
          <h1>Logo Design</h1>
          <p>
            Given the importance of visual identity in the implementation of digital 
            products, I considered it pertinent to create a graphic brand. I tried, 
            above all, to maintain a simple and minimalist aesthetic to provide a 
            legible and visually impactful image. <br>Therefore, the first step was 
            to select the name of the fictitious shelter for which the application 
            was developed. Since it is a shelter for animals looking for a family 
            and the comfort of a home, I combined the words 'para' and 'adotar'. 
            These form the word 'padotar,' which, coincidentally, results in a sound 
            effect similar to their hurried pronunciation. <br>After selecting the name, 
            I began experimenting with the graphic brand, using the digital tool Adobe 
            Illustrator. As seen in the figure below, a brief study of colors was 
            carried out, always associated with neutral tones that refer to pet fur. 
            Above all, my goal was to maintain a simple and minimalist aesthetic, 
            ensuring a legible and visually impactful image.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container" data-aos="zoom-in">
            <img src="assets/padotar/Imagem1.png" alt="logo options">
          </div>
          <p>
            Once the brand was defined, I introduced the typography, giving rise
            to the logo.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container1" data-aos="zoom-in">
            <img src="assets/padotar/Imagem2.png" alt="logo">
          </div>
          <p>
            Padotar's brand image is defined by a symbol depicting a dog and a 
            cat inside a shelter, representing the most common animals found in 
            these institutions. The logo, unmistakably corresponding to the shelter's 
            name, complements this symbol. <br>
            The main color, orange, was chosen for its contrast with other elements, 
            conveying the shelter's values of joy, trust, strength, and ambition. 
            To ensure consistency with the interface design, this color will be 
            integrated into various visual components. <br>
            The logo features a simple sans-serif font, Futura, in a bold style, 
            chosen to visually balance and emphasize the shelter's name.

            In order to enhance the user experience, I opted for a vibrant and

            to evoke serenity and comfort. Black is applied to the text with 
            RGB values below 100% to avoid creating excessive contrast, which 
            could strain the vision of users spending extended periods in the app.

            In selecting fonts, my goal was simplicity, with a focus on enhancing 
            readability for individuals with reduced vision, dyslexia, or cognitive 
            and neurological difficulties. To maintain visual coherence, I opted 
            for two sans-serif fonts: Futura, which was previously used in 
            the logo and is applied to the titles, and Avenir Next, 
            which is used for all other written content. This distinction aids 
            in differentiating headings from paragraphs of text.

            This is when I began making decisions on how to organize the content 
            on Padotar's app, aligning with the project goals I aimed to achieve. 
            Subsequently, I developed a low-fidelity wireframe of the main pages, 
            using basic geometric shapes and minimal details to emphasize the 
            flow and features.

            At this stage, it becomes crucial to delve into the interface to 
            visualize the complete user flow and explore ways to make the process 
            of searching for and adopting a pet as intuitive as possible. This 
            allows us to gain an initial understanding of how the interface will 
            behave when users engage in more specific tasks.

            Two individuals were invited to analyze and provide feedback on the

          <h3 class="list">List of insights obtained from the tests:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Dark Mode:</strong> Is not currently a priority feature, it can be deprioritized for now;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Homepage Optimization:</strong> Remove redundant options on "What are you looking for?" 
              since they're all available in the menu;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quiz Enhancement:</strong> Improve the quiz experience by indicating progress through 
              "Question X of X" for clarity. Avoid asking too many questions to maintain user engagement;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Streamlining Adoption Search:</strong> The adoption section features an extensive page
               of filters to assist in finding the perfect pet, rendering the search bar redundant. 
               Users can still choose the "See all" option to view all available pets without specific filters;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User Account and Settings:</strong> Consider removing features such as favorites, login,
               and profile since user accounts would only serve the purpose of maintaining a favorites list. 
               Additionally, remove app settings as all customizable features have been eliminated;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Content Categorization:</strong> Combine general articles, training, and news into a single tab, 
              introducing a search filter to compile similar information and reduce menu options;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Navigation Optimization:</strong> With the reduction of tabs to about five elements, explore 
              placing the menu at the bottom of the screen for improved accessibility.

            The objective of these tests was to identify usability problems that
            users may encounter in the interface and receive feedback with the
            aim of improving it. Six participants were recruited and all
            performed the same tasks to allow comparison.<br>
            All participants successfully completed six tasks, except for task 2. 
            In this particular task, which was finding the FAQ to clarify a question 
            about adoption, only one participant managed to complete it. After completing 
            the tasks, participants had the opportunity to freely explore the interface. 
            <br>A brief exit questionnaire was conducted to gather their evaluations and 
            suggestions. The prototype received an average rating of 8.5 out of 10.

          <h1>Priority Revisions</h1>
          <p>
            Given the impossibility of implementing all suggested changes, prioritizing 
            the findings became necessary. To achieve this, I employed the Nielsen Scale. 
            After categorizing each suggestion, I chose to prioritize the four most 
            problematic ones, as these were consistently mentioned by various users.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Since the button padding was small, making it difficult to
              navigate the interface, their padding was increased.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since most users prefer to view all animals available for adoption
              first, the filter becomes optional. Thus, when clicking on “Adopt”
              in the menu, we are directed to the list of available animals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since around 85% of users did not find the FAQ, it was placed in
              the most suggested place, in “About Us”, followed by the contact
              form, in case the question was not clarified.
            </li>
            <li>
              Considering that the adoption form is within each animal's profile, 
              certain fields, such as the type of animal and its name, are pre-filled 
              for user convenience.

            In order to prioritize the user experience, an iterative approach was 
            adopted based on the User-Centered Design (UCD) process, where constant 
            validation was sought among potential users. I believe this method was 
            really effective in quickly identifying initial roadblocks to our users
