                <h1 >Hi there, I'm Patr√≠cia!</h1>
                <p>I‚Äôm an aspiring designer motivated by a passion for creative expression and a solid foundation in design principles. I was recently awarded a Master's degree in New Media and Web Practices and, as such, I seek to contribute with innovative ideas, put into practice and improve previously acquired knowledge, in a professional environment.</p>
                <p>I've always had a special enthusiasm for photography and web design. Initially, it was just
                    for fun, but as I acquired tools and knowledge at a technical and theoretical level, I aroused
                    greater interest in the area.</p>

            <ul>
                <li data-aos="fade-right"><strong>Global Explorer ‚úàÔ∏è</strong> I've had the privilege of traversing landscapes both near and far, 
                    from the bustling streets of London to the serene beaches of Cape Verde. I love getting to know other 
                    cultures and their history, traveling is a powerful way to acquire knowledge and create unique, lasting memories.</li>
                <li data-aos="fade-right"><strong>Food Enthusiast üçï</strong> Italian cuisine, with its rich flavors and comforting pasta dishes, 
                    has a special place in my heart. But I also can't resist some tasty picanha.</li>
                <li data-aos="fade-right"><strong>Dog Lover üêï</strong> Beyond my professional interests, I'm an unabashed dog enthusiast, with a soft 
                    spot for Corgis! These adorable, short-legged companions bring endless joy into my life.</li>
                <li data-aos="fade-right"><strong>Crafty Trainer üéÆ</strong> In my downtime, I'm most likely playing games with my friends. Just as 
                    I find immense joy in being a Minecraft architect, empowering my imagination, I also enjoy exploring the 
                    real world while capturing some Pok√©mon.</li>
                <li data-aos="fade-right"><strong>Coin Collector ü™ô</strong> I am fascinated by the world of numismatics. Collecting coins is not 
                    just a hobby, it is a journey through history, culture and art. I like researching and discovering unique 
                    currencies from different countries.</li>
