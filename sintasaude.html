            Sinta Saúde: Designing a mobile app for a local doctor's office
          </h1>
          <p>
            In an ever-evolving digital world, a health clinic's online presence
            is vital for connecting with patients in an effective and
            informative way.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project came about when a friend of mine, who works at this
            clinic, asked me to help her develop a visual example of what their
            mobile app could look like. They wanted to expand their presence to
            mobile devices, creating an experience that would bring the richness
            of their website directly into the palm of their users hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was given the various pieces of content that should be in the app
            and the rest was up to me. However, this project didn't take off, as
            they gave up on the idea, but I still took the opportunity to
            develop my skills and took it as far as I could.

          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The challenge was clear: to faithfully reproduce the content and
            aesthetics of the existing Sinta Saúde website in an accessible and
            aesthetically appealing mobile application. Also integrate some
            extra content that was shared with me.
          </p>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>
            Staying true to the existing design and content, I worked to adapt
            every element for a perfect mobile experience. Every page and
            section was carefully transposed to the mobile version, ensuring
            that users had access to the clinic's essential information quickly
            and intuitively.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <h1>Content Analysis</h1>
          <p>
            As already mentioned, this project is mainly about reproducing the
            web page in a mobile app, as such, an in-depth analysis of the
            competition was not carried out. Instead, I focused on analyzing the
            existing website content structure, types of information, and
            multimedia elements in order to understand the organization and how
            information is presented to users. This will help to determine which
            content elements are essential for mobile users and prioritize them.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure the design aligns with the established brand identity and
            to maintain visual consistency between the website and the mobile
            app, we're gonna use the same guidelines, including colors,
            typography, imagery and speach.
          </p>
          <p>
            At least but not least, I analyzed the navigation menu to figure out
            how it could be transformed into an intuitive, easy-to-use mobile
            menu.

          <h1>Insights</h1>
          <p>
            Based on research into user preferences and industry best practices,
            this app has been crafted to align with the needs and expectations
            of healthcare consumers. Here are key insights that have informed
            the design of this app:

              <strong>Information Prioritization:</strong> Certain information
              sections, such as contact details, services, and appointment
              booking, are highly prioritized by users, indicating their
              essential nature for the mobile app;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quick Access:</strong> Users prefer quick access to vital
              information without extensive scrolling, suggesting a need for
              concise and organized content presentation;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Content Condensation:</strong> The website contains
              extensive textual content that needs to be condensed for mobile
              screens, requiring careful selection of key messages and concise
              wording;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Visual Elements:</strong> High-quality images and
              multimedia elements enhance user engagement;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Intuitive Navigation:</strong> Users expect intuitive
              navigation patterns similar to standard mobile apps, emphasizing
              the need for a clear and straightforward menu structure;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consistent Branding:</strong> Consistency in branding
              elements, such as color schemes and typography, is essential for
              brand recognition and user trust;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Innovative Features:</strong> Exploration of innovative
              features in competitor apps, such as integrated chat support or
              appointment scheduling, can inspire unique functionalities for the
              mobile app.

          <h1>Prioritize Features</h1>
          <p>
            Quality prevailed over quantity as we chose to refine essential
            functionalities, ensuring each feature meets the highest standards
            of our users. Two features were immediately crossed off the list as
            they were not the clinic's priority and given that they still offer
            these services through third-party apps.

          <h3 class="list">Features that stay in the game:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Specialties:</strong> the aim is to show the user all the
              specialties available and provide detailed information about each
              one. When clicking the button to make an appointment, the user is
              redirected to WhatsApp, where he can communicate in real time with
              the clinic and schedule an appointment;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Explore:</strong> here the user can explore some
              pathologies, their causes and treatments;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Staff board:</strong> introducing a staff board ensures
              transparent communication, fosters trust, and enhances
              patient-staff interactions;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Highlights:</strong> activities provided by the clinic,
              such as workshops, will appear prominently on the home page;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>FAQ:</strong> so that there are no doubts left, the most
              frequently asked questions will be available for any user to have
              access to.

            <li>
              <strong>Online consultation:</strong> offering online
              consultations expands accessibility, providing timely healthcare
              services from the comfort of one's home, ensuring convenience and

            Using the same colors and typography as the website, including the
            distinct tones of the logo and incorporating the main color already
            featured in some elements, was a purposeful choice deeply rooted in
            improving brand recognition and user experience.
            <br />
            By seamlessly integrating these elements, we ensure visual
            continuity that resonates with users transition from the website to
            our app. The logo's familiar colors create an immediate connection,
            reinforcing the clinic's identity, while the consistent use of the
            main color on main buttons establishes a visual hierarchy and
            intuitively guides user interactions.

            Following my wireframes, I then used Figma to create an interactive
            high-fidelity, limited functionality prototype that I would use for
            usability testing.

          <p>
            Using the high fidelity, limited functionality prototype I created,
            I started to test my design on users to measure its usability and
            identify any areas of improvement. Since the app was not fully
            developed and the project became personal, only three participants
            were recruited.<br />
            All of them performed the same three tasks to allow comparison and
            all participants managed to complete them successfully.<br />
            Once the tests were finished, I gave them the opportunity to freely
            explore the interface and a brief exit questionnaire was carried out
            where participants were able to give their evaluation and
            suggestions. The prototype obtained an average rating of 7.5 out of
            10 mainly because it wasn't fully developed.

            The resulting design not only aligns with the clinic's brand
            identity but also promises a seamless user experience, offering
            intuitive interactions and empowering patients in their healthcare
            journey. If I were to push this project further, I would:
